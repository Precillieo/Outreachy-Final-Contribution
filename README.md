# Outreachy-Final-Contribution
Developed an approach by working on the Wikipedia dump data, Wikipedia API pages, and the protection pages by using the Python libraries and tools in decompressing and extracting data from the dump file. Did statistical analysis and some basic and complex visualizations to understand and generate insights from the data.  Moreso, Machine Learning algorithms were used to predict if a protection type can be edited or moved. However, the work is still in progress, more sophisticated analysis, visualizations, and accuracies are still gonna be achieved before the submission of the final application.
